RESILIEBNCE
-----------

RESILIENCE, a cyber resilience analyzer for IoT networks which models infrastructure attacks by an adversary meant to minimize the flow of network traffic and identifies the critical links and node locations which should be strengthened. 

This is the result of my research published as a paper in the international journal IEEE Sensors which is a top journal for IoT related research. A copy is available [HERE](https://github.com/uashraf1981/RESILIENCE/blob/master/PROSE%20-%20Proactive%20Resilience%20in%20IoTs%20IEEE%20Sensors.pdf)

The code spans nearly 4000 lines of code written in Java and with some configuration and installation of external resources specified below, can be used to simulate the attack model for any network.

Installation Instructions
-------------------------

Requires installation of several external resources including IBM Cplex Studio for linear programming consgraints generation, Gephi and GraphViz for visualization of the results.
